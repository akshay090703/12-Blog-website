            <h2>My name is Akshay and living the simple life sorted my life</h2>

            <p><strong>I used to be a pack rat.</strong> I had so many things that I thought that I loved, but the truth
                was I couldn't even appreciate any of it because there was too much. Things were terrible. I was doing
                engineering that I hated, a college that I didn't want to study in, and I couldn't hold a relationship.
            </p>

            <h3 class="sub-heading">How I turned things around</h3>
            <p><strong>As a football fan, I am passionate and dedicated to the sport.</strong> I follow my favorite
                teams and players closely, and I enjoy discussing and analyzing the game with other fans. I can spend
                hours watching matches, whether they are live on TV or on a streaming service. I am also a big supporter
                of my national team and I love to cheer for them during international tournaments.</p>
            <p>I am also an avid player of football video games, and I enjoy playing online matches with friends and
                other players from around the world.</p>

            <h3 class="sub-heading">Now I live the simple life</h3>
            <p>Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better. I'm less stressed, enjoy life and work
                more, and I have more free time to enjoy.</p>
            <p> With how much it turned my life around, <strong>I felt like I had no choice but to start sharing how I
                    did it,</strong> and how others can benefit from living a simple life as well, which is why I
                started this site!</p>
